"GeoUmbriaSUIT  is a QGIS plugin for sustainability assessment in geographic"
"  environmental, using environmental,  economics and social criteria. It "
"implements the algorithm  TOPSIS [2] which define a ranking based on "
"distance from  worst point and  closeness to a ideal point, for each used "
"criteria. Entry of  weights can be done directly, if known, or  with the use"
" of a pairwise comparation  table; in this way the user is led to define  a "
"final vector weight, in a repeatable and verifiable path."

"The the plugin works in QGS [3], a free and open source geographic software,"
" quite widely used in several fields. With QGIS and python is quite simple "
"extend the software functionality and build new plugin."

"GeoUmbriaSUIT is hosted in official qgis plugin repository "
"[http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/] and is available under GNU GPL licence. "
"The outputs of geoUmbriaSUIT are both geographic  and graphics. The first "
"shows the maps of the multicriteria analysis results for each elementary  "
"area. The graphic output shows the numerical value of sustainability, with "
"the use of  bars , bubble and points."

"The plugin implements the DOMLEM [4] algorithm based on the \"dominance "
"based rough set\" theory [5]. With its use the user can know the decisional "
"rules derived from the TOPSIS algorithm and give a better overview of  the "
"ranking  of sustainability shows with maps and graphs. The transparency, the"
"  analysis and the  back analysis capability is dramatically increased."

"The plugin geoUmbriaSUIT use a geographic vector file, eg. a shapefile, "
"where the graphics data shows the single evaluation units (for example "
"countries, regions or municipalities), while the alphanumeric data  (the "
"attribute table), describe the environmental, economics and social "
"indicators. With the use of the algorithms available in the plugin, is "
"possible treat separately the indicators in the three dimension of "
"sustainability and compute three different indexes. The linear combination "
"of the three  indexes give  a overall sustainability index for each "
"geographic units.."

"The user can use a wide number of indicators (the same number of those "
"present in the shapefile) and he can use  a set of data prepared by himself."
" However, using the data supplied from ARPA Umbria granted more robustness "
"and repeatability  of output. In the next paragraphs we'll use \"plugin\" "
"and \"geoUmbriaSUIT\" as synonymous."

"We intend for “research units”  an administrative unit described by "
"environmental, economics and social indicators (eg.  municipality, "
"provinces, regions, country, etc.) . The numeric output of geoUmbriaSUIT is "
"the “sustainability index”, given from the linear combination of three "
"different indexes: environmental index, economics index and social index. "
"Higher is the value of those  indexes and better is the performance of a "
"single \"research units\"."
