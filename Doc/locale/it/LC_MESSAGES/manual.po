"The same will be done  with the others social (*S_*) and economic (*E_*) "

"the fields in the table of attribute wit prefix *A_* and use it for the "
"environmental analysis, as  “Environmental criteria”. If we had no chosen to"
" use the prefix, we will have to select all the criteria we need  from the "

"in the cells, otherwise he can use the “Advanced” method, using the table "
"pairwise comparisons. With the row  “Preference” the user can choose the "
"preference of each criterion: if the highest value is preferable in term of "
"sustainability,  the value is  \"Gain\"; on the contrary, if the lowest "
"value for the criterion  is preferable in term of sustainability,  the user "

"sources\",  is a “gain” criterion (high values are preferable) and the "
"default  “Ideal point” is the highest value from this criterion in "
"attributes table. The “Worst point”, instead, is the lowest value from the "
"attributes table for the criterion \"Energy from renewable sources\" .  "
"Otherwise,  the criteria \"Particulate matter – PM10” in the air,  is a "
"“Cost” criterion and the default “Ideal point” value, picked from the "

"a stack – histogram whose the overall height is proportional to "
"sustainability value as the sum (linear combination) of the three indexes "
"(environmental, economics and social value) calculated using TOPSIS "
"algorithm.  The second graph is a “bobble-graph” whose position, dimension "

"three dimension. In particular, the x-axis Is ordered with the environmental"
" index, the y-axis is ordered with economics index, the color (from red to "
"green) is ordered with social index and the dimension of bobble is "
"proportional with the sustainability value. The first two graphs uses Google"
" chart API's and require an active internet connection. The third and the "

"a button named “Extract rules” for extraction of decisional rules on the "
"basis of classification given from TOPSIS algorithm. If a rule as a syntax "
"like  “IF  A>= X THEN AT LEAST i-th”,  we can read it as “ if criterion A "
"has the value greater than or equal to x, then the class of membership will "
"be at least the i-th \". On the other hand, if the extracted rule has the  "
"syntax like  “IF  A>= X THEN AT MOST i-th”, it can be read as “If the "
"criterion A has the value greater than or equal to x, then the class of "
"membership will be at most the i-th ”. If the user select a single rules, "
"the “research units” covered  from the  rules will selected. In other words,"
" selecting a single rule from the text box, we can see the “examples” which "
